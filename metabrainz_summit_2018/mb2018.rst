MetaBrainz Summit 2018
======================

Our infrastructure
------------------


----

Number of servers
=================

* Hetzner: 20 physical machines

* Hetzner Cloud: 8 virtual machines

* Google Cloud: 12 active instances

* Total: **40 servers**

.. note::

    TODO

----

Memory, storage, processing power
=================================

* 1.5 Terabytes of RAM

* 18 Terabytes of storage

* 1.7M Bogomips on 240 CPU cores


.. note::

    TODO.

----


Network traffic
===============

* *180 Terabytes* served this year

* *~50 mbits/s* out, *20 mbits/s* in

* *120* mbits/s out before, due to QNAP


----

Latency

MusicBrainz services
====================

Number of queries served this year
  
**11 Billions** of 200s answers


----


MusicBrainz services
====================

* Incoming Requests: *850 req/s*

* Handled by upstreams: **280 req/s**

----


MusicBrainz services
====================

* MB Website mean response time: **240 ms**
* WS mean response time a bit worse: 20 to 30ms



----

SOLR
====

* 6 servers on Hetzner Cloud
* *180 req/s* during peak time
* Worst mean response time: *125 ms*
* full redundancy, automatic fail over

----

Hetzner Cloud
=============

* Hosting adds 10ms latency on WS (more hops)
* VM CPU performance isn't guaranteed

----

Hetzner Cloud
=============

* low cost: 99â‚¬ / month for 6 VMs (SOLR)
* convenient
* not 100% on, due to Hetzner maintenance ops

----

Docker
======

* *170* containers running
* our setup is not standard enough
* kubernetes is still very far

----

Docker
======

* some issues related to git2consul
* docker-server-configs critical

----

Docker
======

* volumes management is a pain
* some containers are critical
* restarting docker / rebooting machine not possible



----

Stability
=================

* 99.9% availability of core services
* limited failure impact
* crappy cpu fans (6 were replaced)
* still too many **SPoFs**

----

Soon...
=======

* work at reducing SPoFs
* improved database backups using Barman
* moving more services to VMs
* upgrading to 18.04
* upgrading docker + consul


----
